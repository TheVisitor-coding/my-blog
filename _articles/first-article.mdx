### Create a new blog post

Create a new blog post by creating a new markdown file in the `_articles` directory. The file name should be the title of the blog post with spaces replaced by dashes, and the extension should be `.mdx`.

The frontmatter of the markdown file should include the following fields:
- `title`: The title of the blog post.
- `date`: The date of the blog post.
- `description`: A brief description of the blog post.

Here's an example of a new blog post file:
```markdown
# _articles/second-article.mdx[]: # Path: _articles/second-article.mdx

- `title`: The title of the blog post.
- `date`: The date of the blog post.
- `description`: A brief description of the blog post.
- `path`: The path to the blog post file.

Here's an example of how to add a new entry to the `articles` array:
```javascript
# index.mdx[]: # Path: index.mdx
export const articles = [
